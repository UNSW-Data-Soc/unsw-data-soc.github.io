## <a id="python"></a>1. Python

Python, as a general purpose programming language, is highly coveted in the tech industry for the last couple of decades. It's extreme popularity can be attributed to a few of its key strengths:

1. Ease of Use - Python is incredibly easy to pick up as it is a **dynamically** typed, **object oriented** **general purpose** programming language. 
   
   Dynamic typing refers to the fact that a variable's type (e.g. integer or string) can change over time - in some languages, such as C, a variable can only be one type. This makes Python very forgiving to programmers and easy to learn. At the same time, everything is an **object**, which means you can build highly modular systems in Python to create maintainable and scaleable products.
2. Scalable, robust, and powerful libraries - the huge open-source community means it's incredibly likely a library has been developed for almost any problem a data scientist faces.

    Libraries like Sci-kit Learn, Pandas, and NumPy are so powerful they are the gold-standard for wrangling data and manipulating numbers and statistics.
3. Popularity - a huge number of companies have systems built in Python and therefore new programmers and employees must be well versed in Python.

Of course, this is not an exhaustive list, but it's some of the top reasons agreed upon by the community. That being said, Python has its own weaknesses - its ease of use means slow runtime and difficulty in debugging, visualisations can be cumbersome due to the object-oriented nature of the language, and the abundance of libraries and packages means finding the exact library that fits your use case can be difficult.

Alteryx is a no/less-code software product for data manipulation. It's something like Scratch, but for data - with a graphical interface and a simple click-and-drag UI, Alteryx's selling point is its ease-of-use and intuitive development workflow. Alteryx is arguably the top in this area of GUI software product, with many large companies such as PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) using it.
