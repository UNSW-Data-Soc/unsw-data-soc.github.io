Being able to both market and delegate, Shirley Xu can be considered a double threat. When she's not busy with DataSoc, work or study, you can find Shirley advocating for the environment (no disposable cutlery anywhere!), raving about truffle oil and stocking her cat Melon with enough food to last three lifetimes.
