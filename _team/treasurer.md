After a year of leading the Social team, Chenyu decided that he was a fan of the vibe and tried his best to be a part of DataSoc for 2020 (ie. he turned up late to the AGM and his speech was “vote for me, I do actl”). 

As Treasurer, his roles include: reacting to the society bank account with “damn, we still haven’t been paid” and leaving reimbursements to the last possible minute.
