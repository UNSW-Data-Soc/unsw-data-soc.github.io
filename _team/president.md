# Who am I?

A god among men, a legend among gods. Some say that I am the background of DataSoc and the global society as a whole -- i tend to agree.

## 1. Tell me about yourself

To this day, I don’t regret my impulsive decision to study Data Science. I really enjoyed mathematics in high school, but also wanted to get more insight into the business world. This led me to study Commerce/Engineering in my first term at uni.

However, after sitting in my first Physics lecture of the semester, I had a pretty big “oh no” moment and realised that I couldn’t see myself studying this for the next five and a half years. I promptly switched over to Data Science after one and a half weeks of university. Data Science allowed me to have the best of both worlds (maths and economics) with the bonus of programming!

## 2. What's your favourite quote

> IT/Pubs is actually the best portfolio lol
