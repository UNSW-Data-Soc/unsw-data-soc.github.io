Ellen is a multi-talented individual with a wide array of interests. She is capable of making 2-minute noodles in one minute, a very supportive friend and an aspiring cat lady. When sheâ€™s not landing an Atlassian internship or enjoying the occasional bevvy, Ellen can be found reading and dreaming up ways to make DataSoc the greatest society in history.
