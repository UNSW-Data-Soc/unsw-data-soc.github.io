Winston is the type of guy that can always make you laugh whether it’s through bad puns or a good joke. You’ll find him at the gym or WSU making gains one way or another and his chaotic energy is super infectious. If you want someone have a deep chat or have some shits and giggles with, he’s the one (did I mention he has his P’s?).
