*Sweet or savoury?*
<br>
Sweet all the way! I have a massive sweet tooth.
<br><br>
*Favourite spot on campus?*
<br>
There's a spot beyond the little ivy-covered exit from the quad, near High Street where the bus stops (or used to stop). My favourite place is under the massive fig trees there.

*Does pineapple belong on pizza?*
<br>
Absolutely Not. Now, don't get me wrong, I don't have anything against weird and daring flavour combinations - but pineapple? Why ruin a perfectly good pizza with pineapple?
