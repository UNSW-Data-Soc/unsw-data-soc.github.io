Tony is known most widely for giving the best shoulder rides. Lockdown hit him hardest of all - now, he only ever comes to life when reminiscing the bass drops in his favourite songs. But when he’s in his natural habitat you can find him in the thick of the party as the center of attention. You might even see him before you hear him as he shouts out his greatest and deepest love for his homies.

🙏🏼 But until his parties come back, make sure you pray for him and his safety. 🙏🏼
