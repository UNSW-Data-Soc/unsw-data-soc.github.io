Tony is the young and decorated entrepreneur, known most widely for his start-up ‘Mr. Whip’. The business idea came to him amidst the nastiest drop of all the sets in Transmission. In that brief moment he stopped telling his mates: “: Oooooiiya cuzzy I f***n’ love you bro” and devised the genius plan to launch his idea to commercial success. 

With eyes set on the stars; Tony has announced that he will be taking some time off during Summer 2020 to develop his analytical skills with KPMG, then return to propel the business to even greater heights.
