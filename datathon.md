                        <p>
                        In a traditional datathon, competitors are to create a predictive model given a dataset and limited time spanning up to 24 hours. We will be providing a collection of datasets which should be used as part of your solution. You will also have the freedom to use any other data if you'd like to look around.
                        <br><br>
                        As for this year however, we have decided to structure our datathon as more of a case competition, with heavier weighting on evidence and reasoning behind the models alongside predictive accuracy.
